# PongWithElectron

Sometime in 2018, I made a game of Pong to teach myself NodeJS and Electron. This was sitting on my computer for a few months before I uploaded it here to help with my job search since it shows I can use both NodeJS and Electron.

If you download all the files as they're set up onto your computer, you can run the program by running the start.bat Batch file. (Just make sure everything's in the same folder). 

In the game, the user controls a paddle against a computer-controlled opponent. If you play the game, you'll find the opponent paddle will
slow down after every 10 successful hits by the player. After 30 hits, the opponent will stop moving. (Of course, the opponent's speed
resets after each goal).
