# PongWithElectron

Sometime in 2018, I made a game of Pong to teach myself NodeJS and Electron. If you download all the files as they're set up onto your
computer, you can run the program by running the start.bat Batch file. (Just make sure everything's in the same folder). 

You can see a demo of the project here: https://bit.ly/2RsLQee
